# Logistic-Regression

Implement Logistic Regression and run it on the points in the data file "classification.txt"
ignoring the 4th column. That is, consider only the first 3 columns and the 5th column in each row. The
first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; and the 5th column is its classification label +1 or -1. Use
the sigmoid function ÆŸ(s) = es/(1+es).
